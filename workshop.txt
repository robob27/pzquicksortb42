title=Quick Sort Build 42
description=Adds a Quick Sort option to items in your inventory/bags.

description=When used on a single item, it will search explored containers within 3-10 squares (items like Medkits and other similar containers are ignored) for ones that contain the item you're Quick Sorting. If containers with the item are found, it will transfer all non-favorited, non-equipped items from the same source inventory to those containers. This functionality was inspired by the Terraria "Quick Stack to Nearby Chests" button, which I have missed dearly.

description=More Details/Features:
description=- It is possible to queue multiple "Quick Sort" actions back to back to quickly sort large amounts of items.
description=- Multiple containers will be used if multiple containers are nearby that contain the item, but one container cannot fit all of the items being sorted.
description=- "From the same source" inventory means if you, for example, have a Book in both your main inventory and a backpack, and you use Quick Sort on the one in your main inventory, the one in your backpack will not be transferred. This applies vice-versa as well.
description=- Using Quick Sort on an item in a backpack (or any container you access in your inventory) will first transfer the item to your main inventory, and then to the container.

description=Disclaimers:
description=- As with any mod, there is a risk that unexpected things could happen, especially as the game is being updated lots. No warranty!
description=- The specifics about how the mod works (having to walk to the containers to deposit, only sorting from the same source inventory, ignoring Zombies, Medkits and items like them etc) may seem like limitations but these restrictions were carefully crafted to balance the type of gameplay experience my friends and I are looking for. I'm open to suggestions, but please don't be offended if I don't want to incorporate a suggestion!
description=- "Explored containers" means that you should have to have seen the inventory of the container before your character "knows" what items are there. The aim of this is to avoid being able to search for items in unexplored containers by using one you already have, without having to really look around. This seems to work, but it has not been tested long term and I'm not 100% sure on the mechanics of this.
description=- The mod has been updated to the new mod format for Build 42 and seems to work, though testing has not been extensive at this point.

description=Known Issues:
description=- Depending on the closest adjacent/open tile to a container, your character might deposit items through a wall sometimes. I might try to fix this at some point in the future but for now it seems Good Enough TM
