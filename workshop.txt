title=Quick Sort Build 42
description=Adds a Quick Sort option to items in your inventory/bags. Updated for Build 42, including new features!
description=
description=The source code for this mod is available on GitHub at https://github.com/robob27/pzquicksortb42
description=
description=The mod adds the following menu entries to non-favorited, unequipped items in your inventory:
description=- "Quick Sort" - This will attempt to find a nearby container that has the exact same item in it, and transfer the item to that container.
description=- "Quick Sort All" - This will attempt to sort all items from the same source inventory (e.g. your main inventory or a backpack) into nearby containers that have the same items in them. 
description=- "Quick Sort <Category>" - This will attempt to sort all non-favorited, unequipped items from the same category as the item you're Quick Sorting into nearby containers that have the same items in them. E.g. if you right click on a Bandage, this will read "Quick Sort <FirstAid>" and would attempt to sort all first aid items from the same source inventory into nearby containers that have the same items in them.
description=
description=Favorited or equipped items are never sorted. The range for searching for containers to sort items into is configurable in the mod settings, and defaults to 7 tiles.
description=
description=CATEGORY BASED SORTING OPTIONS:
description=By default, if no containers with the exact item are found, it will search for containers with items in the same category as the item you're Quick Sorting and attempt to transfer to those containers.
description=
description=For e.g. if you try to Quick Sort a Bandage, and no containers with Bandages are found, it will look for containers with other "FirstAid" items in them, and attempt to transfer the Bandage to those containers.
description=
description=You can configure the following thresholds to control how category based sorting works:
description=- The minimum number of items in a container that need to be present for it to be even be considered as a potential destination for category based sorting. (Default: 3)
description=- The minimum percentage of items in a container that need to be of the same category as the item being sorted, for it to be considered as a potential destination for category based sorting. (Default: 51%)
description=
description=Category based sorted is enabled by default, but you can disable it in the mod settings if you don't want it.
description=
description=MORE DETAILS/FEATURES:
description=- Supports all languages currently supported by the game.
description=- It is possible to queue multiple "Quick Sort" actions back to back to quickly sort large amounts of items.
description=- Multiple containers will be used if multiple containers are nearby that contain the item, but one container is unable to fit all of the items being sorted.
description=- Using Quick Sort on an item in a backpack (or any container you access in your inventory) will first transfer the item to your main inventory, and then to the container.

description=DISCLAIMERS:
description=- As with any mod, there is a risk that unexpected things could happen, especially as the game is being updated lots. No warranty!
description=- The specifics about how the mod works (having to walk to the containers to deposit, only sorting from the same source inventory, ignoring Zombies, Medkits and items like them etc) may seem like limitations but these restrictions were carefully crafted to balance the type of gameplay experience my friends and I are looking for. I'm open to suggestions, but please don't be offended if I don't want to incorporate a suggestion!
description=- "Explored containers" means that you should have to have seen the inventory of the container before your character "knows" what items are there. The aim of this is to avoid being able to search for items in unexplored containers by using one you already have, without having to really look around. This seems to work, but it has not been tested long term and I'm not 100% sure on the mechanics of this.
description=- All translations were done using AI. Feel free to suggest corrections in comments, or even better, submit a pull request on GitHub with the changes!

description=KNOWN ISSUES:
description=- Depending on the closest adjacent/open tile to a container, your character might deposit items through a wall sometimes. I might try to fix this at some point in the future but for now it seems Good Enough TM
