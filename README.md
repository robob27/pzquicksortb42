Run build.bat to "build" the mod. This will create all of the necessary folders for the mod to work in both:

- the Workshop folder
- the Mods folder

The structure is slightly different for each. The mod also needs to have a "42" folder inside both the Workshop and Mods folders, creating even more copies of the files.

Gitignored files in this project are autogenerated and should not be worked on.
